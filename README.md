## Custom train RT-DETR v2
1. Clone the original RT-DETR repo from https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR.git. We'll work with the subfolder rtdetrv2_pytorch. Its folder structure is as in this repo.
2. Download VisDrone train + validation data from https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset.
Put them under RT-DETR/rtdetrv2_pytorch/dataset/visdrone/train and RT-DETR/rtdetrv2_pytorch/dataset/visdrone/val
3. Get json files in coco format by running **write_json.py** (This step is optional. I already run and put it in the folder)
4. Train with **train.py**.
   **Remark**: I can only train for 3 epochs on google colab and run out of memmory. So I'm not sure if the training parameters are good. It will be cool to create a custom train method which works!
